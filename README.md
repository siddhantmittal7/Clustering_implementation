# Clustering_implementation

One of the most interesting field of machine learning is clustering.
Clustering are used to put objects that are similar into one category or class.
This project report explore three major clustering algorithms K-means,
Hierarchical clustering and DBSCAN to understand the field of clustering.
I primarily focus on K-means algorithm and use the other algorithms
to draw comparison between different approaches and summaries which
algorithm to use in which situation at the end of the report. I have also
performed various experiments to answer following questions: what is
clustering? How it works? How does it perform on different dataset? How
to evaluate how good our clustering was?.
